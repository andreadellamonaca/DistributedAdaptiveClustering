# DistributedAdaptiveClustering

This project is the distributed implementation of an Adaptive Clustering Algorithm in C++;

A recent state-of-the-art clustering algorithm for outlier detection in the case of high-dimensional data has been analyzed
and implemented. Then a P2P simulator has been designed and implemented in order to design a distributed version of the
clustering algorithm with consensus protocol and gossip-based protocol for the communication between peers in the
network. Finally some evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score and Jaccard Distance) have been selected and the
sequential and the distributed version have been compared, through tests on different datasets, to determine the scalability
and the accuracy of the distributed P2P algorithm.
